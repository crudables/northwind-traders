NorthWind Trader project is Power Bi reporting project in which I showed insight deduction from raw data.
The dataset was provided by mavenanalytics for their monthly challenge.
The dataset consists of seven tables namely:
Categories
Customers
Employees
Orderdetails
Orders
Products
Shippers

From the data in the dataset, I created models that map the relationships between the tables and merged the 
orders and orderdetails table to make a star schema possible.
